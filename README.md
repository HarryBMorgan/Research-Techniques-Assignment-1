# Research-Techniques-Assignment-1
The first assignment for my Research Techniques in Astronomy course at University.

There was 3 tasks completed.
1) Creating a Python function to calculate the first 3 Bessel Functions.
2) Creating a Python programme to calculate the critical density of the universe. Also, using DS9 to alter an RGB image and identify objects in in. (I kinda dropped the ball on this one, the Python code was well off.)
3) Taking data (not included due to size of files) and preforming image corrections to it using Python. Then taking the corrected images to DS9 for image analysis.

UPDATE: Marked at 73.5%.
